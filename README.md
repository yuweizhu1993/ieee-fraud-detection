# IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection - Kaggle

This competition(https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection) aims to improve the credit card fraud detection accuracy. 

The training dataset contains approximately 500,000 observations with 434 columns. The exact meaning of most columns has been masked. 

In this competition, we mainly apply the LightGBM model with group cross-validation methods to predict fraud. To improve our prediction accuracy, we did intensive feature engineering around time, transcation amount, card feature, etc.

This solution ended with top 2% (silver medal) in the private leaderborad.
